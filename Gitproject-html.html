        <h2>My Fortnite Dream</h2>
        <p> My name is Oloni Timilehin Daniel, A.K.A Danieloloni.</p>
        <p> I currently live in Nigeria and i love doing many things, but one of them is to be a Fortnite pro and to make money on the game.</p>
        <p> I am very good at the game, infact the best in my school but there's a big problem. My ping is to high.</p>
        <p> When i first started playing the game. I had about 90-120ping but since chapter 3 season 2 it has been higher than normal. Now am getting around 130-200ping. </p>
        <p> I also forgot to mention that i play on a nintendo switch but am really good.</p>
